The MDI takes security seriously. There are real 
concerns with running software on your computer,
and you should carefully consider the factors below 
when installing and using the MDI Desktop and associated apps.

Only you can decide whether to trust the software you install
and use, and you bear all responsibility for doing so.

### MDI Desktop

The MDI Desktop is an 
{% include external-link.html href="https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-desktop-app/" text="open-source project" %}
maintained by the MDI team to allow you to review its code,
and we always abide by our 
[Code of Conduct](https://midataint.github.io/docs/code-of-conduct/).

The Desktop app code is 
{% include external-link.html href="https://www.google.com/search?q=code+signing" text="properly signed" %},
and, on macOS, 
{% include external-link.html href="https://www.google.com/search?q=notarization+macos" text="notarized" %},
for safe installation and use, so you can trust
that the code is the same as available on GitHub. The expected 
app author or publisher is "University of Michigan" on Windows and
"Thomas E. Wilson" on Mac.

You may still be prompted to confirm certain installation actions,
e.g., that the app is not "frequently downloaded" or "not recognized".
These messages occur when an app has fewer users as compared
to very common programs; they do _not_ indicate that malware was detected. 

The Desktop performs the following essential tasks:
- sets configuration parameters and saves them using Local Storage
- uses SSH to securely connect to remote servers
- uses {% include external-link.html href="https://cran.r-project.org/" text="R" %} to install packages from GitHub on your local or remote computer
- uses {% include external-link.html href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" text="R Shiny" %} to run web applications in the app's browser

The app has one action (opening a new Terminal) that loads an external 
window on your system. You will be prompted to confirm your agreement 
the first time you access it. 

### MDI Apps Framework

Like the Desktop, the MDI Apps Framework is an 
{% include external-link.html href="https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-apps-framework/" text="open-source project" %}
that runs an
{% include external-link.html href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" text="R Shiny" %} app.

The framework has features that access your local file system
and execute actions on your computer to allow you to:
- load and save data files and bookmarks of app states
- run resource intensive data analyses
- if desired, edit code files and execute system commands that you write
- load and execute third-party apps

### Third-party data analysis apps

The purpose of the MDI Desktop and Apps Framework
is to run data analysis apps. Unlike the
Desktop and Framework, the MDI team does not develop
those apps and is not responsible for their contents.

MDI apps run in 
{% include external-link.html href="https://cran.r-project.org/" text="R" %}, 
which means that they have access to the computer running the web server. 
Apps can open files and run commands on the operating system. 
It is therefore essential that you trust the authors of any apps you use.

Apps you trust should follow the MDI 
[Code of Conduct](https://midataint.github.io/docs/code-of-conduct/).
Ask the app's developer if you are in doubt. 
If you cannot identify the developer of an app, don't use it!

You will be prompted the first time you use an app
to indicate that you have considered the potential risks and 
agree to continue.

In addition, the framework scans all apps
for an intent to execute code on the operating system. 
If detected, you will be prompted to allow the app to load.
