A logical series of actions is required to get the
MDI installed and running on the intended computer.

### Connect to a server (remote, node modes)

If you will run the MDI web server remotely, first
click the **Connect** button, which 
executes an appropriate SSH command in the black
terminal window.  Log in as dictated by your server.

As needed, you can type shell commands in the terminal window,
or click **Terminal** to open a separate shell in a new window.

### (Re)Install the MDI

The first time you work on a new target computer you must click 
**(Re)Install** to install the needed MDI repositories and packages.

Usually, you can skip re-installation in future visits.
However, when you want to update to a new version of R, you must
(Re)Install again. You might also sometimes want to
force a hard update of all code.

The MDI requires many resources to run, so initial installation 
will take many minutes, especially on a Linux server where code
needs to be compiled. It will go much faster the second time. 

Alternatively, if your server and tool suite in a single-suite
installation support an apps server Singularity container,
no further installation will be needed and it will be very fast.

Watch the installation progress in the black terminal window - 
you will be ready to proceed when you see a command prompt
awaiting input.

### Start and use the server

Once the MDI is installed, click **Start** to launch the 
MDI Apps Framework, which will load into a web browser on the right
side of the app.

Notice the **tall vertical open/close button** in the middle or to the
left of the screen. This button toggles the visibility of the server
configuration and terminal panels (the server is always
there reporting its log stream, even when you hide it).

The MDI Desktop is a minimal web browser. You will
start with one Docs and one Apps tab. If desired, you can open 
additional Apps tabs running on the same server. Documentation links
within the apps will load into the Docs tab.

Please see the documentation of the 
[MDI Apps Framework](/mdi-apps-framework)
for information on how to proceed once the interface is running.

### Stop the server and disconnect

When you are done working, click the tall vertical open/close button
to expose the server controls and click **Stop** to end your 
server session. In remote modes, click **Disconnect**
to end your SSH session. 

You can also just close/quit the desktop app.
Any servers and jobs running on remote computers will terminate
once the SSH connection is dropped. 

### Quit the Desktop

Electron apps use significant system resources. You are encouraged to 
always close all windows, and to fully quit the app on Mac computers,
when you are done using the MDI Desktop.
