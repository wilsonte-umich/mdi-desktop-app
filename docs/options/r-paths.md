The MDI requires that R be installed and available to run
on the computer that acts as the web server. 

If the following options are left blank, `Rscript` or `Rscript.exe` 
must already be available via the `PATH` environment variable,
however, it is recommended to explicitly set the R path.

### Rscript Path (local mode)

If provided, `Rscript Path` must be a full path to a valid
`Rscript` or `Rscript.exe` executable file.

**Examples**

- **Windows**: C:\Program Files\R\R-4.1.0\bin\Rscript.exe
- **Mac**: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/bin/Rscript

### R Load Command (remote, node modes)

If provided, `R Load Command` will be called on a remote
server prior to attempting to launch the MDI. 
`R Load Command` must make `Rscript` available 
via the system `PATH` environment variable.

**Examples**

- module load R/4.1.0 (e.g., on Great Lakes)
- export PATH=/path/to/R-4.1.0:$PATH

Importantly, R does not need to be available on your remote
server if it and the tool suite in a single-suite installation
both support Singularity apps containers, since R will be
installed in the container.
